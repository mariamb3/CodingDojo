    <p>Virginia Tech was my dream school! I cried when I got accepted - I was happy don't get me wrong. Just a bit
        dramatic!
        First year and half were the worst years of my life. I was just so tired and out of energy since I was planning
        on finishing early (Finishing college in 3 years instead of 4).
        However, VT broke my heart again and said no due to my class schedules. Hence, I am now running out of credits
        and they don't want to give me enough scholarships
        because I am not going to be a full time students. So... God only knows what my plan looks like in the future
        even though
        I am always known to be the girl who has her excel sheet plan ready and all that but.. Oh well! I'll keep you
        posted in my next blog on how I got through it.</p>
